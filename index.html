                Today marked the start of my on-the-job training at the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), where I was assigned to handle data entry for the payroll system. I approached this new role with excitement and determination to learn and contribute effectively. Upon arriving at the office at 7:00 AM, I was warmly welcomed by my supervisor, who began the day with a brief orientation. During this session, I received an overview of the department and the importance of accurate payroll data entry, helping me understand the critical role I would play in ensuring employees' information is correctly recorded and maintained. Following the orientation, my supervisor introduced me to the payroll software used by DENR, guiding me through its main features and demonstrating how to input, update, and verify employee details, which provided me with a practical understanding of the system. Once I felt comfortable navigating the software, I was tasked with entering employee information, including names, PhilHealth IDs, salary details, and bank account numbers, with a strong emphasis on accuracy and attention to detail. After completing the initial data entry, my supervisor and I conducted a quality check to verify the accuracy of the information, and I received constructive feedback and guidance for improvement. Although I faced a few challenges, particularly in familiarizing myself with the software interface, my supervisor's patience and support helped me overcome these obstacles. By the end of the day, I felt more confident in using the payroll system, which will undoubtedly help me perform my tasks more efficiently in the future.

            <p>On the second day of our on-the-job training, our supervisor taught us the essential skills of UTP cable crimping and testing. We started by learning the correct way to cut the cables to the proper length and strip the outer insulation to expose the individual wires. Our supervisor showed us how to arrange the wires in the correct color sequence, following the T568A or T568B standard. We then carefully inserted the wires into the RJ45 connectors, ensuring they were fully seated before using the crimping tool to secure them in place.
              After completing the crimping process, we moved on to testing the cables to verify our work. Our supervisor explained the importance of using a cable tester to check for continuity and proper connections. We tested each cable we made, checking for any issues such as crossed wires or poor connections. This immediate feedback helped us understand the importance of precision and attention to detail in the crimping process. By the end of the session, we felt more confident in our ability to create and test UTP cables effectively.</p>
